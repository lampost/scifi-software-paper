The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) will demonstrate the principle of muon beam emittance reduction via ionization cooling.  Muon beam cooling will be required for the proposed Neutrino Factory or Muon Collider next generation facilities.  The emittance before and after the cooling cell must be measured precisely and this is achieved with two scintillating fibre trackers, each placed in a toroidal magnetic field.  This paper describes the software reconstruction for the fibre trackers: the GEANT4 based simulation; the geometry and configuration implementations; digitisation; spacepoint reconstruction; pattern recognition; and the final track fit based on a Kalman filter. The performance of the software is evaluated by means of Monte Carlo studies and the precision of the final track reconstruction is measured.
